# QT-exercises

This project is a collection of Qt exercises and small applications created while learning and experimenting with the Qt framework (C++). Most of them are based on YouTube tutorials and online examples.

The main purpose of this repo is to explore GUI development, learn new programming techniques, and improve my C++/Qt skills through hands-on practice.

Key Topics:
  - Qt Widgets and Layouts
  - Signal and Slot Mechanism
  - File I/O in Qt
  - Custom Dialogs and Forms
  - Basic MVC Concepts
  - Event Handling
  - Timer-based applications
  - Using Qt Designer
These exercises are made for practice and learning, and some may be improved or extended in the future.
